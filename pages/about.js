        I'm Sarim and I use this space to collect things (articles, quotes,
        projects) that I find interesting. My vision for this space is to
        function as a personal collection that can outlive me. I'd like to build
        a digital identity of sorts that I can use for reflection and leave it
        as a time capsule.

        These days I am brainstorming personal projects at the intersection of
        hardware and software. In my spare time, you'll find me cloning projects
        off of Github and reverse-engineering them. Not the most efficient way
        to learn but works really well for me, especially in terms of speed.
        Long term, I'd like to build the muscle memory that some prodigy devs
        have.
