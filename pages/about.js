        I'm Sarim and I use this space to collect stuff that I find interesting.
        My vision for this space is to function as a personal collection that
        can outlive me. I'd like to build a digital identity of sorts that I can
        use for reflection while I'm alive and leave it as a time capsule for
        others to follow.

        These days I am brainstorming personal projects at the intersection of
        hardware and software. In my spare time, you'll find me cloning projects
        off Github and reverse-engineering them. Not the most efficient way to
        learn but it works really well for me, especially in terms of speed.
        Long term, I'd like to build the muscle memory that some prodigy devs
        have. Feel free to ping me about anything you found interesting here.
        Always happy to chat.
